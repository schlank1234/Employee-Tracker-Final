### Hints
* You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.
* Focus on getting the basic functionality completed before working on more advanced features.
* Review the week's activities for a refresher on MySQL.
* Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.
## Minimum Requirements
* Functional application.
* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.
* The command-line application should allow users to:
  * Add departments, roles, employees
  * View departments, roles, employees
  * Update employee roles
## Bonus
* The command-line application should allow users to:
  * Update employee managers
  * View employees by manager
  * Delete departments, roles, and employees
  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
## Commit Early and Often
One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:
* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.
* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.
Follow these guidelines for committing:
* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.
* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.
* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).
* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.
We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
